### Hello 👋
I'm a student on a journey to learn computer science. Currently, I'm diving into the world of web development, primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft interactive web pages. However, I'm also proficient in Python and constantly seek opportunities to broaden my horizons by exploring new programming languages and technologies.
